# Number Guessing Game 🎲🔍

Hello and welcome to my Number Guessing Game repository! My name is Isabella, I'm a Junior full-stack JavaScript developer with a background in sustainable food systems and a flaming passion for coding.
I've written this little Java Number Guessing Game 🚀, motivated by my love for Picnic's innovative approach to groceries 🛒 and their sustainable app-only service.

## About Me 🙋‍♂️
I graduated in Braizl, in Nutritional Sciences with focus in sustainable food systems. There I was in intern for United Nations NGO's (you will see a recommendation letter on my CV) as "communications officer" - basically their tech savy assistant. That's where I started diving into WordPress website creation.

After moving to the Netherlands 2.5 years ago, I started as a live support agent on the tech scale-up TicketSwap. There I quickly became lead and was awarded MVP of the Company due to how deep I dived into the project, 
giving trainings for all departments and running that extra-mile for customer happiness. I spent so much time with the developers there, that I decided to become a developer myself.

I started learning programming on my lunch breaks and weekends, until I was offered a traineeship in Dharma Media (Amersfoort).
After 7 months there, I became fluent in JavaScript, HTML, Css, version control and SCRUM (I'm a PSD I - Scrum certified Developer).

Finishing my traineeship, I got a job as a junior full stack at Soleo BV (Almere). There I mostly work with plain JavaScript and SQL.
However, they don't provide trainings or contact with new technologies, so after work I'm pursuing a degree from my country (remotely) and I do programming projects on the weekends (like building websites for friends, for example).

I'm on the lookout for a role where I can be mentored, dedicate all of my hours, and contribute to a project I'm deeply passionate about - a role where I can create an impact and grow 🌟.

## Why Picnic? 🛍️

With my admiration for Picnic's commitment to affordability and sustainability, I couldn't resist the chance to apply for the vacancy at the beating heart of Amsterdam's tech scene - the Picnic Tech Academy.
It's the perfect place for a budding developer like me to improve my skills and work on diverse and innovative projects. 

## My Project 💡

This simple Java project showcases my initial steps into the world of Java.
As soon as I saw the vacancy, I decided to look into it and see similarities with JavaScript where I can transfer my current coding skills and build amazing products.
It's a console-based Number Guessing Game where the goal is to guess a randomly generated number. Simple yet fun, it reflects my readiness to jump into new challenges and learn.
